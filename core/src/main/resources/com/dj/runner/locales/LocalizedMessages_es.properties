Title=¿Cual es la relación entre proyectos?
body=Cuando hay proyectos que dependen unos de otros, Jenkins puede hacer un seguimiento de  qu\u00E9 proyectos padres est\u00E1n siendo utilizado por otros proyectos hijos usando un registro de firmas de los ficheros generados. Echa un vistazo a esta pagina:  <a href="https://jenkins.io/redirect/fingerprint">the fingerprint support</a>.

This\ allows\ Jenkins\ to\ correlate\ two\ projects.=Esto facilita que Jenkins pueda correlacionar los dos proyectos
The\ upstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ its\ build\ artifacts.=Que el proyecto padre registre la firma de todos los ficheros que genera.
For\ this\ feature\ to\ work,\ the\ following\ conditions\ need\ to\ be\ met\:=Para esta funcionalidad, son necesarias las siguientes condiciones:
The\ downstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ the\ upstream\ files\ it\ uses.=El proyecto hijo almacena las firmas de los ficheros o artefactos que necesita y que fueron generados por otros proyectos padres.

title=Estadísticas de carga: {0}
blurb=\
  Las estadísticas de carga hacen un seguimiento de la métrica de utilización de recursos:\
  <dl> \
    <dt>Número total de ejecutores</dt> \
    <dd>\
      Para un ordenador: es el numero de ejecutores para cada máquina. \
      Para una etiqueta: es la suma de todos los ejecutores que comparten la etiqueta. \
      Para todo Jenkins: es la suma de todos los ejecutores de la instalación de Jenkins. \
      Este número cambia no sólo por cambios en la configuración, sino además cuando hay nodos que se ponen fuera de línea. \
    </dd> \
    <dt>Número de ejecutores ocupados</dt> \
    <dd>\
      Esta línea representa el número de ejecutores, entro los contabilizados arriba, que están procesando trabajos. \
      El ratio de estos entre el total representa el rango de utilización de recursos. \
      Si todos los ejecutores estan ocupados durante mucho tiempo, considera la opción de añadir más nodos. \
    </dd>\
    <dt>Tamaño de la cola</dt>\
    <dd>\
      Este es el numero de tareas que estan en la cola esperando por un ejecutor libre \
      bien sea en este nodo, en esta etiqueta o en este Jenkins. \
      El número no incluye trabajos que estan en el periodo de gracia ni aquellos que estan en la \
      cola porque hay ejecuciones del mismo proyecto activas. \
      Si esta línea supera el cero, significa que este Jenkins podría ejecutar mas trabajos añadiendo \
      más nodos.\
    </dd>\
  </dl>\
  El gráfico es exponencial calculando medias de los datos recogidos periódicamente. \
  Se hacen tomas de datos de 3 tipos: cada 10 segundos, cada minuto y cada hora, para los valores de intervalo pequeño, mediano y grande respectivamente.

  Añadir un agente permanente a Jenkins. Es llamado ''permanente'' porque Jenkins no provee ningun tipo de \
  integración de alto nivel con estos agentes, como pueda ser aprovisionamiento dinámico. \
  Selecciona este tipo si no hay ningún otro tipo mas adecuado. Por ejemplo cuando se añaden \
  maquinas físicas o virtuales gestionadas desde fuera de Jenkins, etc.

  Algunas veces se producen errores mientras se leen datos, por ejemplo cuando un plugin añade \
  datos y después se desactiva, o cuando no hay código que actualice los datos cuando cambia la \
  estructura, o cuando Jenkins es degradado a una versión anterior. \
  Jenkins avisa de todos estos errores y no carga los datos, lo que le permite arrancar y \
  funcionar adecuadamente.

# Load statistics keep track of three key metrics of resource utilization: \ 
# <dl> \ 
# <dt>Total number of executors</dt> \ 
# <dd>\ 
# For a computer, this is the number of executors that the computer has. \ 
# For a label, this is the sum of all executors across all computers in this label. \ 
# For the entire Jenkins, this is the sum of all executors across all computers in this Jenkins installation. \ 
# Other than configuration changes, this value can also change when slaves go offline. \ 
# </dd> \ 
# <dt>Number of busy executors</dt> \ 
# <dd>\ 
# This line tracks the number of executors (among the executors counted above) \ 
# that are carrying out builds. The ratio of this to the total number of executors \ 
# gives you the resource utilization. If all your executors are busy for \ 
# a prolonged period of time, consider adding more computers to your Jenkins cluster.\ 
# </dd>\ 
# <dt>Queue length</dt>\ 
# <dd>\ 
# This is the number of jobs that are in the build queue, waiting for an \ 
# available executor (of this computer, of this label, or in this Jenkins, respectively.) \ 
# This doesn't include jobs that are in the quiet period, nor does it include \ 
# jobs that are in the queue because earlier builds are still in progress. \ 
# If this line ever goes above 0, that means your Jenkins will run more builds by \ 
# adding more computers.\ 
# </dd>\ 
# </dl>\ 
# The graph is exponential moving average of periodically collected data values. \ 
# 3 timespans are updated every 10 seconds, 1 minute, and 1 hour respectively.

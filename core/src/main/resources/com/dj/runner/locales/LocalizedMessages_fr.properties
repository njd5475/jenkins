Title=Que sont les "relations entre projets"?
body=\
	Lorsque vous avez des projets qui dépendent les uns des autres, Jenkins peut tracer quel build \
    de projet en amont est utilisé par quel build de projet en aval, en utilisant \
    les enregistrements créés par \
    <a href="https://jenkins.io/redirect/fingerprint">le support de l''empreinte numérique</a>.
For\ this\ feature\ to\ work,\ the\ following\ conditions\ need\ to\ be\ met\:=Pour que cette fonctionnalité marche, les conditions suivantes sont requises:
The\ upstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ its\ build\ artifacts.=Le projet en amont enregistre les empreintes numériques de ses artefacts de build.
The\ downstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ the\ upstream\ files\ it\ uses.=Le projet en aval enregistre les empreintes num\u00E9riques des fichiers amont qu''il utilise.
The\ downstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ the\ upstream\ jar\ files\ it\ uses.=Le projet en aval enregistre les empreintes numériques des fichiers jar en amont qu''il utilise.
This\ allows\ Jenkins\ to\ correlate\ two\ projects.=Cela permet à Jenkins de mettre en corrélation deux projets.

  Les statistiques d''utilisation du système permettre de garder trace de trois métriques de mesure de la charge: \
  <dl> \
    <dt>Nombre total d''exécuteurs</dt> \
    <dd>\
      Pour un ordinateur, il s''agit du nombre d''exécuteurs de cet ordinateur. \
      Pour un libellé, cela correspond à la somme des exécuteurs sur tous les ordinateurs possédant ce libellé. \
      Pour Jenkins, il s''agit de la somme de tous les exécuteurs disponibles sur tous les ordinateurs rattachés à cette installation de Jenkins. \
      En dehors des changements de configuration, cette valeur peut également changer quand les esclaves se déconnectent. \
    </dd> \
    <dt>Nombre d''exécuteurs occupés</dt> \
    <dd>\
      Cette ligne donne le nombre d''exécuteurs (parmi ceux comptés ci-dessus) \
      qui s''occupent des builds. Le ratio de ce nombre avec le nombre total d''exécuteurs \
      donne l''utilisation des ressources. Si tous vos exécuteurs sont occupés pendant une \
      période prolongée, pensez à ajouter plusieurs d''ordinateurs à votre cluster Jenkins.\
    </dd>\
    <dt>Longueur de la file d''attente</dt>\
    <dd>\
      C''est le nombre de jobs qui sont dans la file des builds, en attente d''un exécuteur \
      disponible (respectivement pour cet ordinateur, pour ce libellé ou pour Jenkins en général). \
      Cela n''inclue pas les jobs qui sont dans la 'période silencieuse' (quiet period ou période \
      de délai), ni les jobs qui sont dans la file à cause de builds précédents toujours en cours. \
      Si cette ligne dépasse 0, cela signifie que Jenkins pourra lancer plus de builds en ajoutant des ordinateurs. \
    </dd>\
  </dl>\
  Ce graphe est une moyenne glissante exponentielle de données collectées périodiquement. \
  Les périodes de mise à jour sont respectivement toutes les 10 secondes, toutes les minutes \
  et toutes les heures.

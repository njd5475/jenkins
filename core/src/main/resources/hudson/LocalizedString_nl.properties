Title=Wat zijn projectrelaties?
body=\
  Wanneer je projecten ontwikkelt die van elkaar afhankelijk zijn, kan Jenkins voor jou uitzoeken welke \
  bouwpoging van een bovenliggend project gebruikt wordt door een onderliggend project. Dit gebeurt aan \
  de hand van de geregistreerd <a href="https://jenkins.io/redirect/fingerprint">elektronische vingerafdrukken</a> van \
  de door een bouwpoging opgeleverde artefacten.
For\ this\ feature\ to\ work,\ the\ following\ conditions\ need\ to\ be\ met\:=De volgende voorwaarden dienen voldaan te worden om met deze functionaliteit te werken:
The\ upstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ its\ build\ artifacts.=Het bovenliggende project registreert elektronische vingerafdrukken van zijn bouwartefacten.
The\ downstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ the\ upstream\ files\ it\ uses.=Het onderliggend project registreert de vingerafdrukken van de bestanden van het bovenliggende project.
The\ downstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ the\ upstream\ jar\ files\ it\ uses.=Het onderliggende project registreert de elektronische vingerafdrukken van de gebruikte jar bestanden van bovenliggende projecten.
This\ allows\ Jenkins\ to\ correlate\ two\ projects.=Dit stelt Jenkins in staat om 2 projecten met elkaar in verband te brengen.

WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.NoSuchPermalink=Er bestaat geen permanente referentie ''{0}'' voor {1}
WorkspaceSnapshotSCM.NoWorkspace=\
  {0} {1} heeft geen gekoppelde werkplaatskopie.\n\
  Waarschijnlijk was er geen enkele job die deze kopie nodig had, wanneer deze bouwpoging plaats vond.\n\
  Gelieve een nieuwe bouwpogin in {0} te starten, teneinde een nieuwe werkplaatskopie te bekomen.

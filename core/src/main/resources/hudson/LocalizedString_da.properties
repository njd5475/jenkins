Title=Hvad er et "projektforhold"?
For\ this\ feature\ to\ work,\ the\ following\ conditions\ need\ to\ be\ met\:=For at denne feature fungerer skal f\u00f8lgende v\u00e6re opfyldt:
The\ downstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ the\ upstream\ files\ it\ uses.=Downstream projektet opsamler filfingeraftryk af de upstream filer det benytter.
body=\
Har du projekter der er afh\u00e6ngige af hinanden kan Jenkins f\u00f8lge hvilket byg af upstreamprojektet \
der bruges af hvilket byg af downstream projektet ved at bruge filfingeraftyrk
This\ allows\ Jenkins\ to\ correlate\ two\ projects.=Dette tillader Jenkins at korrelere to projekter.
The\ upstream\ project\ records\ the\ fingerprints\ of\ its\ build\ artifacts.=Upstream projektet opsamler filfingeraftryk af sine byggeartifakter.

Medium=Mellem
Timespan=Tidsperiode
Long=Lang
blurb=\
Belastningsstatistikkerne overv\u00e5ger tre hovedmetrikker omkring ressourceudnyttelse: \
<dl> \
<dt>Det totale antal afviklere</dt> \
<dd>\
For en computer er dette antallet af afviklere den computer har. \
For en etiket er dette summen af alle afviklere, p\u00e5 alle computere, med denne etiket. \
For hele Jenkins er dette summen af alle afviklere p\u00e5 alle maskiner i denne Jenkins installation. \
Udover igennem konfigurations\u00e6ndringer kan denne v\u00e6rdi \u00e6ndre sig n\u00e5r slaver g\u00e5r offline. \
</dd> \
<dt>Antal afviklere i brug</dt> \
<dd>\
Denne linje viser antallet af afviklere (som delm\u00e6ngde af de ovenfor optalte) \
der udf\u00f8rer byg. Forholdet imellem dette antal og summen af afviklere giver dig et indtryk af \
ressourceudnyttelsen. Hvis alle dine afviklere er optagede i l\u00e6ngere perioder b\u00f8r \
du overveje at tilf\u00f8je flere computere til din Jenkins klynge. \
</dd>\
<dt>K\u00f8 l\u00e6ngde</dt>\
<dd>\
Dette er antallet af jobs i byggek\u00f8en der venter p\u00e5 en tilg\u00e6ngelig afvikler (p\u00e5 denne computer, \
denne etiket, eller denne Jenkins, respektivt.) \
Dette inkluderer ikke antallet af jobs der er i stilleperioden, det inkluderer heller ikke \
jobs der er i k\u00f8 fordi tidligere k\u00f8rsler af samme jobs stadig er i gang. \
Hvis denne linje g\u00e5r over 0 betyder det at Jenkins kan k\u00f8re flere byg hvis du tilf\u00f8jer flere computere. \
</dd>\
</dl>\
Grafen er en eksponentiel moving average af de periodisk opsamlede data. \
De 3 tidsperioder bliver opdateret hvert 10.sekund, hvert 1 minut og hver 1 time respektivt.
